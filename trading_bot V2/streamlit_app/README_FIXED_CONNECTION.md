# Trading Bot - Fixed API Connection

This version of the trading bot includes a fix for the Alpaca API connection issues. The main changes are:

## What's Fixed

1. **Direct Alpaca API Connection**: The bot now connects directly to the Alpaca API without requiring a local server, making it work on Streamlit Cloud and other deployments.

2. **API Key Management**: Credentials are properly stored and retrieved from session state, environment variables, or Streamlit secrets.

3. **Trading Mode Support**: Both paper trading and live trading modes are fully supported.

## New Files

- `utils/alpaca_api.py`: Contains direct Alpaca API connection functions
- `utils/fixed_api.py`: Updated API interface that uses direct connections

## How to Use

1. Download and extract this package
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `streamlit run Home.py`
4. Navigate to Settings and enter your Alpaca API credentials
5. Click "Test Connection" to verify

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the API connection:

1. **Check your credentials**: Make sure your Alpaca API key and secret are correctly entered
2. **Check trading mode**: Ensure you're using the correct trading mode (paper or live)
3. **Check logs**: Look for error messages in the Streamlit logs
4. **Network issues**: Ensure your deployment environment has access to the Alpaca API endpoints
