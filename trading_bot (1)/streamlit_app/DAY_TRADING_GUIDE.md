# Day Trading Strategy Guide

This guide provides information on day trading strategies implemented in the AI Trading Bot.

## What is Day Trading?

Day trading involves entering and exiting positions within the same trading day. Unlike swing or position trading which may hold positions for weeks or months, day traders close all positions before the market closes.

## Key Day Trading Strategies

### 1. VWAP Scalping

**Description:** Uses Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) as a key reference point for quick entries and exits.

**Implementation:**
- Entry: When price dips below VWAP and bounces back with increased volume
- Exit: When price rises to a predetermined percentage above entry or after a set time limit
- Time frame: Usually 1-5 minute charts
- Best for: Liquid stocks with high volume and volatility

### 2. Opening Range Breakout (ORB)

**Description:** Trades breakouts from the defined range established during the first period after market open.

**Implementation:**
- Define a range: Monitor the high and low of the first 15-30 minutes after market open
- Entry: When price breaks above/below the opening range with good volume
- Exit: When price hits target or reverses against the breakout
- Time frame: 1-5 minute charts
- Best for: High volatility stocks, market open trading

### 3. Price Action Reversal

**Description:** Identifies intraday reversal patterns at key support and resistance levels.

**Implementation:**
- Identify key intraday support/resistance: Use previous day's high/low, round numbers
- Look for reversal patterns: Pin bars, engulfing patterns, inside bars
- Entry: When a reversal pattern forms at support/resistance with volume confirmation
- Exit: At next resistance/support level or set risk-reward ratio
- Time frame: 5-15 minute charts

### 4. Momentum Scalping

**Description:** Capitalizes on short-term momentum moves in price, usually confirmed by indicators.

**Implementation:**
- Entry: When RSI or other momentum indicators show oversold/overbought conditions with reversal
- Exit: When momentum slows down or reverses
- Stop loss: Tight, just beyond recent swing high/low
- Time frame: 1-5 minute charts
- Best for: Volatile stocks during high volume periods

### 5. News Gap Trading

**Description:** Trades price gaps resulting from overnight news or earnings announcements.

**Implementation:**
- Identify stocks with gaps: Look for >1% gaps from previous close
- Wait for confirmation: First 15-30 minutes to establish direction after open
- Entry: After confirmation of gap continuation or fade
- Exit: When momentum fades or at predetermined targets
- Time frame: 5-15 minute charts

## Indian Market Specific Strategies

### 1. Nifty/Bank Nifty Gap Strategy

**Description:** Focuses specifically on gap trading in the main Indian indices.

**Implementation:**
- Monitor pre-market: SGX Nifty gives indication of opening gap
- Entry: Trade in direction of first 15-minute candle's close after gap
- Exit: Target previous day's high/low or key resistance/support levels
- Best for: Nifty and Bank Nifty futures trading

### 2. NSE Open-High-Low Strategy

**Description:** Based on the first hour range in NSE stocks.

**Implementation:**
- Record first hour high and low of selected stocks
- Entry: Buy breakouts above first hour high, sell breakouts below first hour low
- Exit: Fixed risk-reward (typically 1:2)
- Best for: Liquid, high-volatility NSE stocks

### 3. FII/DII Flow Strategy

**Description:** Bases trades on Foreign/Domestic Institutional Investor flows, which are particularly impactful in Indian markets.

**Implementation:**
- Monitor daily FII/DII data from exchanges
- Identify patterns of sustained buying/selling over consecutive days
- Focus on sectors/stocks with highest institutional activity
- Entry: After confirming price action aligns with flow direction
- Best for: Mid-to-large cap stocks with high institutional holdings

## Risk Management for Day Trading

1. **Position Sizing:** Never risk more than 1-2% of your account on a single trade
2. **Set Stop Losses:** Always use hard stops at technical levels
3. **Risk-Reward Ratio:** Aim for at least 1:1.5, preferably 1:2 or greater
4. **Use Time Stops:** Close positions that don't move as expected within a set time
5. **Track Performance:** Keep detailed trading journal to identify what's working
6. **Consider Market Timing:** Avoid first 5-10 minutes after market open (high volatility)
7. **Mind the Fees:** Day trading involves frequent transactions; factor in costs

## Technical Indicators for Day Trading

1. **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price):** Key intraday reference level
2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** Identify short-term overbought/oversold conditions
3. **Moving Averages:** 9 and 20 EMAs are popular for intraday trends
4. **Bollinger Bands:** Identify volatility and potential reversal points
5. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** For momentum confirmation
6. **Volume:** Critical for confirming breakouts and reversals

## Common Day Trading Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overtrading:** Taking too many positions reduces focus and increases fees
2. **Emotional Trading:** Fear and greed lead to breaking strategy rules
3. **No Plan:** Trading without a defined entry, exit, and risk management plan
4. **Averaging Down:** Adding to losing positions is risky in day trading
5. **Not Adapting:** Market conditions change throughout the day
6. **Ignoring News:** Being unaware of scheduled news events/releases
7. **Chasing Stocks:** Entering after a stock has already made a big move

## Best Practices

1. **Pre-market Routine:** Prepare watchlists, review news, check earnings
2. **Market Breadth:** Check overall market direction and sector performance
3. **Technical Levels:** Identify key support/resistance levels before trading
4. **Trade Management:** Scale in/out of positions rather than all-in/all-out
5. **Session Awareness:** Different market hours have different characteristics
6. **Record Keeping:** Document every trade with reason for entry/exit
7. **Post-market Review:** Analyze the day's trades to improve strategy
